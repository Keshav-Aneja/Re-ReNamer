# Re-ReNamer

Use this to rename multiple files in your folder at once in numerical order.<br>
Out of Irritation from naming hundereds of files one-by-one, I developed this Python Script through which you can rename all your files at once <br>

How To Use? <br>
Step 1: Copy the path of the folder in which you want to rename the files <br>
Step 2: Paste the path_add string <br>
Step 3: Run the Script...Ta Da... All the files have been renamed in a numerical order
